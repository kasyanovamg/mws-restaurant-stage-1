##### How to set up simple python server
In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5500 (or some other port, if port 5500 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 5500. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's <a href="https://www.python.org/">website</a> to download and install the software.
